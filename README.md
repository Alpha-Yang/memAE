### memAE
This is an unofficial implementation of paper "Memorizing Normality to Detect Anomaly: Memory-augmented Deep Autoencoder (MemAE) for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection"

Majority of the code are based on the original repo https://github.com/donggong1/memae-anomaly-detection

I have only tried it on the UCSDped2 dataset, I got an accuracy of 94% which is similar to the one that is reported in the paper. 
Note, I didn't use the EntropyLossTerm during training.
